    "# The Peaking Power-Plants\n",
    "\n",
    "*Created by [Industrial Informatics Department](http://iid.ciirc.cvut.cz/), Czech Technical University in Prague.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "You are the boss of an electricity distribution company. Based on the contracts with the end-users, you know the demand on the amount of the electrical energy between hour $t$ and $(t+1)$ next day; i.e., you have vector $\\bar{d} = (d_0, d_1, \\dots, d_{23})$ of demands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your company owns several power-plants and wants to cover the demands by switching these plants on and off. There are two types of power-plants: `base` and `peak` plants (there are $n_{base}$ and $n_{peak}$ of these plants).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Base power-plants** (zdroje základního zatížení) are cheap, but it takes a long time to start them and turn them off; therefore, they need to be either turned on or turned off the whole day. These plants produce $e_{base}$ energy every hour and their running cost is $c_{base}$ every hour.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* **Peak power-plants** (špičkové zdroje) are fast, and can be turned on/off every hour, but typically the price is high. These plants produce $e_{peak}$ energy every hour and their running cost $c_{peak}$ (every hour).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The surplus energy is being stored in the batteries (storage) and can be used later. However, there is a loss modeled by parameter $\\gamma \\in [0,1]$. If $k$ units of energy leave the storage, only $\\gamma \\cdot k$ units can be used to cover demands (the rest, i.e., $(1-\\gamma)\\cdot k$, is lost).\n",
    "\n",
    "The capacity of the storage is limited to $s_{max}$ units, and due to technological restrictions, it is impossible to take the energy from the storage and store it inside simultaneously. The produced energy needs to cover the demands or be stored in the batteries (energy cannot just vanish). The storage is empty at the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to minimize to total cost (turning the power-plants on/off) while covering all the demands.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\mathbf{d} = (d_0,d_1,\\dots,d_{23})$ – vector of demands\n",
    "* $n_{base},n_{peak}$ – number of the respective power-plants\n",
    "* $c_{base}, c_{peak}$ – cost needed for the running of the respective type of the plant (per hour)\n",
    "* $e_{base}, e_{peak}$ – amount of energy generated by the respective type (per hour)\n",
    "* $s_{max}$ – storage capacity\n",
    "* $(1−\\gamma)$ – energy loss of the storage (only $\\gamma \\cdot k$ energy units can be used out of $k$ units)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the testing purposes, you can experiment with the following instance:"
